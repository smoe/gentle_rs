# Glen: Next Verification And Return

Prepared 2026-10-18. Steffen should forward **this file after his push**.
This is the current covering request, not a release freeze or a request to
repeat all historical audits. Older linked prompts are background, not new
execution authority. Continue development independently of these checks.

## Source And Isolation

Fetch published `smoe/gentle_rs main` once and record the resolved full SHA and
tree. Test that source in a clean detached checkout with an explicitly set,
run-owned absolute `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` outside the checkout. Record toolchain,
platform, features/profile and raw lockfile SHA-256. Use only binaries built
from this checkout; preserve the primary checkout, shared caches and historical
evidence. A later main commit does not invalidate this scoped report or require
another synchronization request, but it is not automatically accepted by it.

No push, workflow dispatch, tag, publication, provider contact, live model,
new GUI capture or package/container build is requested. Existing normal CI
can be inspected without restarting it. Keep `package-opt1-fallback` separate;
the selected .13 packaging recipe remains opt2. Codex runs no local Rust.

## Focused Checks

1. **README metadata repair:** verify the `57a2403a` repair is present. Run the
   release-version regression below and inspect the new normal push CI when
   available. Historical run `39066178748` at `1c5be317` failed the README
   label guard on Linux and Windows; it did not test the repair. Both root
   libraries and all five stripped-child families passed at that older SHA.
   Preserve those bounded results rather than calling the failed run green.

   ```sh
   cargo test --locked -j1 --test release_version_consistency
   ```

2. **Sequence-design follow-up:** verify `8a0e2670` and `958b2238` are included.
   Execute the core/protocol tests that the failed older workspace run did not
   reach, plus the shared engine and CLI boundaries:

   ```sh
   cargo test --locked -p gentle-sequence-design -j1
   cargo test --locked -p gentle-protocol -j1 sequence_design
   cargo test --locked --lib --no-default-features -j1 sequence_design -- --test-threads=1
   cargo test --locked --bin gentle_cli --no-default-features -j1 sequence_design -- --test-threads=1
   cargo check -q --locked -j1
   cargo build --locked --no-default-features -j1 --bin gentle_cli --bin gentle_examples_docs
   ```

   Replay tutorial 06.07 and the four actual CLI acceptance tests using the
   [functional procedure](sequence_design_acceptance.md#exact-candidate-functional-checks).
   For these functional checks the dev binaries just built are sufficient;
   record that profile, without claiming package or performance acceptance.
   Set `GENTLE_TUTORIAL_BIN_DIR` to the absolute run-owned target's `debug`
   directory, `GENTLE_SEQUENCE_DESIGN_CANDIDATE` to the recorded full HEAD, and
   `GENTLE_SEQUENCE_DESIGN_EVIDENCE_DIR` to a fresh absolute evidence directory:

   ```sh
   python3 -m unittest scripts.test_sequence_design_audit_oracle scripts.test_sequence_design_tutorial -v
   ```

   All four actual CLI tests must execute; skips and the four Rust CLI unit
   tests are not substitutes. Check retained-best behavior after match-cap
   overflow, incomplete status without false proof flags, cancellation clearing
   output, lexical ties and independent IUPAC coordinates/strands/palindromes.
   Preserve both strategies' joint motif/global/window-GC, tampering,
   materialization, save/reopen and same-session undo/redo checks. Historical
   `de9df8af` prototype acceptance stays separately attributed.

3. **Integrated .13 expression/storage/tutorial paths:** follow the focused
   commands, generator freshness/parity checks and two real-CLI starter replays
   in [the preparation handoff](internal_13_preparation_handoff.md#external-completion-before-candidate-selection).
   Its owner dispatch/publication section is not part of this request. Use the
   same freshly built binaries with `scripts.test_release_workflow_tutorials`;
   no optional-binary skip is acceptance. Retain LF/CRLF and quoted-path results,
   deterministic container order, conservative expression refusals and unchanged
   review state/files. Report drift; do not regenerate historical evidence.

Use `--locked` throughout. If dependencies are already cached, `--offline` may
also be used; otherwise record retrieval failures as environmental. Do not
change the lockfile or widen resource limits silently to obtain a pass. Missing
tools, zero selected tests, timeouts and unrun platforms remain explicit.

## Remaining Six-Gate Boundaries

Use the [six-item ledger](glen_audit_followups_20261008.md) as the status owner,
and the [release-stage request](glen_final_candidate_execution_handoff.md) only
when release preparation is authorized. Audit preservation, 08.04 contracts,
live-agent acceptance, honest visual evidence, scroll benchmarks and package
acceptance retain their individual evidence boundaries. These focused checks
do not close all six. Existing tutorial/link repairs and historical audits
must not be reissued as unfinished work. Native/physical-host, model, scroll,
package and scientific verdicts stay separate; this request authorizes none
of their additional execution.

## How To Return Results

Send **one concise response to Steffen for forwarding into the main Codex
chat**. Do not rely on direct Glen-to-Codex messaging or assume a path on one
host exists on the other. Include:

- Tested full SHA/tree, platform, Rust/Cargo versions, features/profile,
  lockfile and binary hashes, and any same-source CI URL/conclusion.
- Per-check `pass`, `fail`, `not_run` or `blocked`, actual selected test counts,
  skips, exact commands/exit codes and primary failure versus cascades.
- Remaining six-gate boundaries, distinguishing new results from historical
  passes and software execution from native/scientific/release acceptance.
- Evidence location and SHA-256 of its manifest, plus any concrete defect and
  minimal proposed repair. Do not modify or push source as part of this check.

Supply a small folder/archive containing `REPORT.md`, command/exit-code logs,
raw stdout/stderr, CI/CLI receipts and a per-file SHA-256 manifest. Steffen can
copy it to `/tmp/glen-verification-<short-sha>-<date>/` on the Codex host and
relay the path and manifest hash here. Keep bulky binaries, raw captures and
reference inputs on Glen's host with hashes/locations; transfer them only on
request. Never include credentials or private projects. Record content hashes
as identity checks, not authenticated provenance or human scientific approval.

## Preserved Prompt Records: Not Active Instructions

The following received files are committed verbatim for history:

- [Release-link repair prompt](release_handoff_link_repair_prompt.md): repair
  already closed; its preparation-time failure and old runner/version status
  are historical, not a request to restore the deleted .12 planning ledger.
- [Sequence-design closure prompt](sequence_design_closure_codex_prompt_20261014.md):
  closure was reconciled in the plan/acceptance records. The current
  [compiler decision](decisions.md#workspace-compiler-compatibility) supersedes
  its broader proposed workspace minimum/publication gate; select no MSRV.
  The [issued handoff's SHA correction](glen_sequence_design_acceptance_handoff_20261014.md)
  remains intact.
- [Original Claude VKORC1 prompt](vkorc1_acceptance_codex_prompt_20261014.original-claude.md):
  retain the original separately from the [reconciled task](vkorc1_acceptance_codex_prompt_20261014.md).
  Its in-progress CI, undecided .13 aim and other snapshot claims are not
  current status. `--offline` is not a substitute for `--locked`, nor proof
  that a lockfile was rewritten. No old embedded dispatch is authorized here.
